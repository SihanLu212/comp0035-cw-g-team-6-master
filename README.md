# COMP0035 Coursework 2022-23

This repository contains starter code for coursework 1 and 2.

You will have created your repository on GitHub when you accepted the classroom environment.

To set up your project in your python coding environment (IDE):

1. Clone the repository in your IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code) from GitHub. Follow the help in your IDE.
2. Add a virtual environment (venv). Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [navigate to your project directory and use python.](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
3. Install the requirements from requirements.txt. Use the instructions for your IDE
   or [use python in your shell.](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files).
4. Edit .gitignore to add any config files and folders for your IDE. PyCharm, VisualStudio Code, Xcode and NetBeans have
   already been added.

# IMPORTANT

**Do not change the names of the markdown or python files.** Automated scripts will be used to separate files for marking purposes, if
you change the filename your coursework will be missed.

Before you submit the coursework:

1. Update this README.md with any additional guidance that may be required to allow your project code to run.
2. Update requirements.txt with any additional python libraries used in your project.
